  <h3 class="cattalk">A message from Nermal:</h3>
  <div class="my-class">Hi there! As a kitten, I have seen the whole world, and I bring a wealth of experience to the homes I am a part of. When you adopt me, you aren't just adopting a kitten; you're adopting a whole world.</div>
  
  <h3>Nermal was just a little pound kitten...</h3>
  <div class="my-class">
    <p>Hailing from the streets of Seattle, Washington, Nermal found her way to Los Angeles by way of the Pacific Coast Highway. Braving the wilds of Oregon and three border crossings, Nermal finally and safely crossed the border of California in late 2020. She has since been vaccinated and is ready to find her furr-ever home.</p></div>
  
  <h3>Do you want to adopt Nermal?</h3>

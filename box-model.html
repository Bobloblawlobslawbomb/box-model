  <h3 class="cattalk">A message from Nermal:</h3>
  <span class="my-class">Hi there! As a kitten, I have seen the whole world, and I bring a wealth of experience to the homes I am a part of. When you adopt me, you aren't just adopting a kitten; you're adopting a whole world.</span>
  <h3>Nermal was just a little pound kitten...</h3>
  <div class="my-class">
    <p>Hailing from the streets of Valparaiso, Chile, Nermal found her way to the United States by way of the Pacific Coast Highway. Braving the wilds of Guatemala and several border crossings, Nermal finally and safely crossed the border of California in late 2020. She has since been vaccinated and is ready to find her furr-ever home.</p></div>
  <h3>Do you want to adopt Nermal?</h3>

    <p>All inquiries and interest should be directed to Nermal's email address at <a href="mailto:nermal@ohs.org">nermal@ohs.org</a></p>
